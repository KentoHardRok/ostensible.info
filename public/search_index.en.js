A data center exists inside of a zone, a zone is a group of redundant data centers. A region is a group of redundant zones. Each zone is labeled by the physical area the inhabit... more or less.\nAWS regions are independent of each other. So your data doesn't leave a region without your explicit consent.\nServices within AWS are deployed either within an AZ, a region or globally so look it ip.\n\n#coursera/AWScloudessentials/api\nInteracting with AWS\n\nHow to interact with the AWS API:\n\nAWS Management console\nAWS command line interface\nAWS software development kits (SDK)\n\n\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management\nIAM\nHow it works\n![[Pasted image 20211105123552.png]]\nThis is what a section of a policy looks like. This is much like many other places that have this. Its a role based method of allowing people access to perform actions on AWS. Obviously this has no bearing on your application that you build.\n\n\nThe Version element defines the version of the policy language. It specifies the language syntax rules that are needed by AWS to process a policy. To use all the available policy features, include \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\" before the \"Statement\" element in all your policies.\n\n\nThe Effect element specifies whether the statement will allow or deny access. In this policy, the Effect is \"Allow\", which means you’re providing access to a particular resource.\n\n\nThe Action element describes the type of action that should be allowed or denied. In the above policy, the action is \"*\". This is called a wildcard, and it is used to symbolize every action inside your AWS account.\n\n\nThe Resource element specifies the object or objects that the policy statement covers. In the policy example above, the resource is also the wildcard \"*\". This represents all resources inside your AWS console.=\n\n\nand here is yet a more granular policy:\n{\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\t\"Statement\": [{\n\t\t\"Effect\": \"Allow\", \n\t\t\"Action\": [ \"iam: ChangePassword\", \n\t\t\"iam: GetUser\" \n\t\t]\n\t\"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}\" \n}]\n\nIAM Roles\nRoles can be assumed by many different identities and are temporary in nature. This really is focused on setting a sort of RBA for users without explicitly creating each user in IAM. For a hybrid deployment for example you can assign roles to internal groups so as users within your pre-established enterprise require access, they will be automatically assign resources based on their group association. IAM best practices also tries to follow general user account best practices such as:\n\nLock down the Root user account\nLeast privilege\nappropriate use only\nand use when possible\nconsider using an identity provider\nthere is also AWS SSO\n\n#coursera/AWScloudessentials/security\nApplication Diagram\n![[Pasted image 20211105133311.png]]\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-1/","title":"Week 1"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-2/":{"body":"AWS compute\nRunning compute stuff in AWS\nThis is simply refering to the background services supporting the applications you stand ip in  AWS. This is the storage and memory that give horsepower to your applications running in this cloud. In AWS you are given 3 options: virtual machines, containers, and serverless.\nAlthough amazon uses the term web service to refer to these instances, it doesnt mean that your simply limited to that. \nIn AWS EC2 instances are closer to virtual machines than anything else. Amazon Machine Image AMI is an image available on AWS, Amazon supplies these or you can create and supply one on your own. They have images that are optimized for different things so be mindful of this. The name of these dictate the type of image followed by the size. \nYou can also create an AMI from one of your existing EC2 instances and resuse that image when necessary. Every AMI on the amazon market place has a unique AMI ID. These IDs are unique to each region!\nWhen you launch an EC2 instance from an AMI it transitions to to pending then running.  Now it can be stoped, restarted, stop-hibernate, or shutdown\n![[Pasted image 20211105145947.png]]\nWhen running you are billed for that instance. You are not billed for everystate so thats why this is important. When an intance is stopped you are not billed for it. Although you are still billed for any storage that is being used by that instance. \n#aws/ec2\nEC2 instance\nThis is really just running linux services in the cloud. closest to running vms locally. These servers power your application by providing CPU, memory, and networking capacity to process users’ requests and transform them into responses. For context, common HTTP servers include:\n\nWindows options, such as Internet Information Services (IIS).\nLinux options, such as Apache HTTP Web Server, Nginx, and Apache Tomcat.\n\nautoscaling\nThe autoscalling of the EC2 instances can happen as a result of conditions you can set yourself.\nimage builder\nthis works to reduce the effort necessary to keep images up to date. It offers a simple graphical interface with built-in automation, and AWS provided security settings. \nlightsail\npreconfigured packages for making ec2 instances easier to deploy\nContainer services\nThis includes AWS ECS and AKS. ECS manages a cluster of ec2 instances that act as hosts for the containers. a cluster can consist of several ec2 instances. \nAmazon EKS is conceptually similar to Amazon ECS, but there are some differences.\n\nAn EC2 instance with the ECS Agent installed and configured is called a container instance. In Amazon EKS, it is called a worker node.\nAn ECS Container is called a task. In the Amazon EKS ecosystem, it is called a pod.\nWhile Amazon ECS runs on AWS native technology, Amazon EKS runs on top of Kubernetes.\n\n#/aws/beanstalk\nElastic Beanstalk\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and Internet Information Services (IIS).\nYou can simply upload your code, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.\nServerless\nEvery  of serverless mentions four aspects.\n\nNo servers to provision or manage.\nScales with usage.\nYou  pay for idle .\nAvailability and fault  are built-in.\n\n#aws/fargate\nExplore Serverless Containers with AWS Fargate\nAmazon ECS and Amazon EKS enable you to run your containers in two modes.\n\nAmazon EC2 mode\nAWS Fargate mode\n\nFargate\nAWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. AWS Fargate removes the need for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.\n#/aws/lambda\nLambda\nThis allows you to run code on demand in the cloud and only get charged for what you run when you run it. You can setup triggers for the code to run as a result of some actions in connection to other amazon services such as uploading a document in an S3 bucket.\nHow Lambda Works\nThere are three primary components of a Lambda function: the trigger, code, and configuration.\n\nThe code is source code, that describes what the Lambda function should run. This code can be authored in three ways.\n\nYou create the code from scratch.\nYou use a blueprint that AWS provides.\nYou use same code from the AWS Serverless Application Repository, a resource that contains sample applications, such as “hello world” code, Amazon Alexa Skill sample code, image resizing code, video encoding, and more.\n\n#coursera/AWScloudessentials/vpc\nAWS Networking\nA VPC operates inside a region. Once in a region you create the VPC by setting the ip range and cidr notation for subnet. Now create subnets. To create the subnet you need a name, Availability Zone, and ip range.\n![[Pasted image 20211115095746.png]]\nSubnets\n#aws/internet_gateway\nInternet Gateways\nThis just facilitates an internet connection for your newely created VPC, without this you get no internet.\n#aws/vgw\nVGW\nThis can be used to create a connection for a hybrid network where the cloud is directly connect to your on prem solution. \n#aws/route_table\nRoute tables\nIn a VPC, any subnets created inside of a single VPC are assumed routable to eachother. This is the local route for the entire vpc. Subnets can be more granular. You can create custom route tables then associate them with subnets. \nACL\nThis is just the IPtables for the route table. The route tables are kind of treated like an independant element that can be associated with other services. This ACL gets associated with a route table and is used to protect subnets. \nSecurity Groups\nHere is where you can create firewalls that either block or permit all network traffic. This are stateful so it will acknowledge flows starting / originating from within the VPC network / EC2 instance. default setting is to block all incoming traffic but allow all outgoing traffic. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-2/","title":"Week 2"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-3/":{"body":"#coursera/AWScloudessentials/storage\nBlock vs File Storage\nStorage Types\nFile Storage\nFile Storage is closer to the traditional windows setup in an hierarchy.\nCommon use cases for file storage include: \n\nLarge  content repositories\nDevelopment  environments\nUser  home directories\n\nBlock Storage\nFile storage treats files as a singular unit, block storage splits files into fixed-size chunks of data called blocks that have their own addresses. Since each block is addressable, blocks can be retrieved efficiently.\nObject Storage\n![[Pasted image 20211116213714.png]]\nObjects, much like files, are also treated as a single unit of data when stored. However, unlike file storage, these objects are stored in a flat structure instead of a hierarchy. Each object is a file with a unique identifier. This identifier, along with any additional metadata, is bundled with the data and stored.\nWith object storage, you can store almost any type of data, and there is no limit to the number of objects stored, making it easy to scale. Object storage is generally useful when storing large data sets, unstructured files like media assets, and static assets, such as photos.\nEC2 Instance Store\nThis is the temporary block level storage for an instance. This gets tied directly to the EC2 instance that its associated with. If the instance gets deleted than the storage also gets deleted as well. \nSo when is this a good idea?\nThis storage solution is ideal if you are hosting applications that replicate data to other EC2 instances, such as a hadoop cluster. For cluster based workloads, having the speed of locally attached volumes and the resiliency of replicated data helps you achieve data distribution at high performance. \nAlso ideal for temporary storage of information.\nEBS Volumes\nAKA, Amazon Elastic lock Storage, So your storage is separate from your EC2 instance and remain persistent. EBS volumes act just like external drives in more ways than one. \n\nEBS can be connected to either a single instance in a one-to-one relationship with an EC2 instance. Amazon has also released a EBS multi-attached feature that enables volumes to be attached to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously. This feature is not available for all instance types and must be in the same availability zone.\nBe mindful that this is in fact separate from the EC2 instances so if something goes wrong with the instance the EBS volume wont suffer the same fate.\nYour limited to the size of the external drive, since it has a fixed limit to how scalable it can be. \n\nThese instances are also scalable in 2 ways\n\nIncrease the volume size, as long as it doesn't increase above the maximum amount of storage (16TB), that can be divided up so long as to not exceed 16TB.\nYou can attach multiple volumes to a single EC2 instance. \n\nBenefits of Using Amazon EBS\nHere are the following benefits of using Amazon EBS (in case you need a quick cheat sheet).\n\nHigh availability: When you create an EBS volume, it is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to prevent data loss from single points of failure.\nData persistence: The storage persists even when your instance doesn’t.\nData encryption: All EBS volumes support encryption.\nFlexibility: EBS volumes support on-the-fly changes. You can modify volume type, volume size, and input/output operations per second (IOPS) capacity without stopping your instance.\nBackups: Amazon EBS provides you the ability to create backups of any EBS volume.\n\nso when is this a good idea?\nReally this is useful when you need to retrieve data quickly and have data persistent long-term. These are typically used for:\n\nOperating Systems: Boot/root volumes to store an operating system. this is typically referred to as an EBS-backed AMI.\nDatabases: A storage layer for databases running on Amazon EC2 that rely on transactional reads and writes.\nEnterprise applications: For reliable block storage...\nThroughput-intensive applications: Applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-3/","title":"Week 3"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/","title":"Dockerizer"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/dockfu/":{"body":"#docker/dockerfile\nDockerfile setup\nThe dockerfile is the file used to standup/build an image to be used in docker or podman or whatever compatible container environment. There are a few steps that are necessary and some that are optional. \nFROM alpine:latest\nRUN apk update &amp;&amp; \\\n    apk upgrade &amp;&amp; \\ \n    apk add \\\n        wireguard-tools \\\n        iptables \\\n        bash\nENV WG_PORT=51820\nENV NUM_CLIENTS=5\nENV PRIV_NET=10.0.0.\nENV EXT_IP=172.16.0.10\nWORKDIR /etc/wireguard\nCOPY wg0.conf wgpeer.conf peer_setup.conf ./\nCOPY createwg /usr/local/bin/\nRUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/createwg &amp;&amp; \\\n    mkdir client\nENTRYPOINT [\"createwg\"] \nCMD [\"wg-quick\",\"up\",\"wg0\"]\n\nThis isnt the most perfect dockerfile but it is mine and I can walk through it pretty easily. From the top we have the FROM command, this sets the base image. Its not a good idea to use the latest tag for the version because it could update and break things.\nThe next example we have is the RUN tag. This is a command that is run during the build process. This is important as it is not re run after the image is built so make sure this is used to establish the environment for the container. \nENV and not used here is ARG. In this ENV is used to make environmental variables inside the new image that can be used by scripts and programs inside the container once the image is run. These ENV variables can be modified during run time. ARG is similar but only used during the image being built. These values can not be modified during runtime. \nWORKDIR does exactly that, changes the working directory while image is built. \nCOPY is used to copy files to and from the container.\nENTRYPOINT is the next interesting command with its brother CMD. they are both commands that are run during image run time. so when you say docker run &lt;image&gt; these commands are run, the difference between these two is that entrpoint cannot be changed with a command line argument during runtime BUT CMD can be changed. ENTRYPOINT cannot be changed but CMD can be changed. easy enough right? source\nThe real beauty in all of this is when you run a command or process using a container, it can be the perfect environment for that application, guaranteed to run then bail and disappear when finished. you just have to know what that environment shoud look like.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/dockfu/","title":"Dockerfu"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/","title":"Links"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/where-have-you-been/":{"body":"SiteDescriptionLink\nAnswerLookupHow to add GIT to windows pathAdd GIT to PATH\nThe Geek DiaryPhysical interface to dockerHow To\nspeedguide.netGreat site for researching ip port infoPort Info\nDAS BlinkinReally smart guy who has saved me in the pastblog\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/where-have-you-been/","title":"Where have I been"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/","title":"Networking Info"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/cisco-ipsec-configs/":{"body":"#vpn/layer3/ipsec #cisco/asa \nIPSec config examples\nSo there are 2 main phases to an IPSec. There is the initial key exchange which is necessary to establish credentials to the second phase which is the enctypting of traffic. For the first phase the here is an example config that I'll follow up with an explanation.\ncrypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal sec-prop\n protocol esp encryption aes-256\n protocol esp integrity sha-512\n\nThe first line is basically the titling of this transform set on this ikev2 transform set. The second command is establishing the encryption protocol used to establish the ike communication. All of these settings must match on both sides. The third line is the Authentication hash for data integrity of the ike connection. \nCrypto ipsec security-association pmtu-aging infinte\n\nThis command actually establishes global defaults for lifetime in the ipsec phase 2. If you configure the times in the crypto map than this time will not be used. \ncrypto map tunmap 1 match address tun-traffic\ncrypto map tunmap 1 set peer 192.168.100.2\ncrypto map tunmap 1 set ikev2 ipsec-propsal sec-prop\ncrypto map tunmap interface outside\n\nThis is the phase 2 tunnel map configuration. More or less the glue of the tunnel to bring together the different phases. The first line highlights significant traffic through an access list. The second line labels the peers IP address. The 3rd line ties in the phase one tunnel configuration. The final like actually turns on the tunnel on to an interface. \ncrypto iaskmp identity key-id hq-tun-group\n\nThis line is used when an asa connects through a nat configuration. This passes a new isakmp identity so it can be identified as something other than the outside interface IP address. This happens because the tunnel groups are labeled with the IP address which the certificates use to label the endpoints, so this command should match the id to a name tunnel-group on the peer.\ncrypto ikev2 policy 1\n  encryption aes-256\n  integrity sha\n  group 21\n  prf sha512\n  lifetime seconds 36500\n\nHere is the significant part of the IPSec phase 2 configuration which labels the aspects of the ipsec tunnel. Here we still have the encryption standard used, integrity hash, DH group selected, PRF or the pseudo random function is whats used to create keying material. Then finally the the lifetime of each key.\ncrypto ikev2 enable outside\n\nAnd this is the command needed to enable the phase 2 on the outside interface. By phase 2 I mean ipsec tunnel.\nWe must configure the group policy which is where we set the phase one protocol to use.\n  group-policy 192.168.100.2 internal\n  group-policy 192.168.100.2 attributes\n  \tvpn-tunnel-protocol ikev2\n\nNow we move onto the fun stuff, tunnel group configuration. This is the portion that sets the tunnel attributes like authentication details, certificate or pre-shared key to be used. The tunnel group name should match the peers external info which I am pretty sure is the CN field in the certificate they present. I'll revisit this... maybe.Ok this blog that I have stumbled upon, who has helped in the past dives a little deeper into this topic and I think its worth noting here as well. \nThe tunnel groups are kind of like the core of the vpn configuration. There are two main elements to the tunnel groups, Attributes and Types. \ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 type ipsec-l2l\n\nthis is an example of the tunnel group type. Although this is a l2l type there are other options. \n| Types         |                                                |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| ipsec-l2l     | l2l configurations                             |\n| ipsec-ra      | The old IPSec client vpn type (deprecated)     |\n| remote-access | The new client vpn type for both SSL and IPSec |\n| webvpn        | The old SSL client vpn type (deprecated)       |\n| Attribute Sets     |                                                                        |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| generel-attributes | general attributes used with most tunnel group configurations          |\n| ipsec-attributes   | specific IPSec attributes used for l2l and client IPSec configurations |\n| ppp-attributes     | specific ppp attributes                                                |\n| webvpn-attributes  | specific ssl attributes used for webvpn configurations                 |\nHere we can see some of the configuration options and the pairs of tunnel group types with the attributes.\ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 type ipsec-l2l\ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 general-attributes\n default-group-policy 192.168.100.2\n\nThis also is the section that connects the group policy to the tunnel group. I feel like its important to identify how these different sections connect to eachother.\nThe tunnel group would be where the we would define authentication. The default is to authenticate locally but of course you can use ldap or other radius authentication as well.\ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 ipsec-attributes\n ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key *****\n ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-key *****\n\nThe only aspect I didnt really touch on here is the ACL needed to identify interesting traffic. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/cisco-ipsec-configs/","title":"Cisco IPSec Configs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/ipsec-ip-port-info/":{"body":"#vpn/ipsec\nIPSec Port information\nPort/ProtocolIPSec (VPN tunneling) uses:\nProtocol 50ESP Encapsulation Header\nProtocol 51AH Authentication Header\nudp/500(IKE) Internet Key Exchange\nudp/4500NAT traversal\n\nIKE or the internet key exchange is used to form a secure connection so that keys can be exchanged between clients. There is a lot to dig into this topic such as aggressive mode vs main mode and the security implications of both.\nok lets dive a little since we are here anyway. Necessary information include how to connect: hashing algorithm to use, encryption, and DH group, and desired IKE SA. The DH exchange will need to be performed to send a secret over an insecure medium. Finally the peers exchange identities and authentication material.\nIKE SA can be established via aggressive mode or main mode negotiation, this document covers Main Mode exchange which is the one typically deployed.\nAggressive mode is the less secure of modes and is typically used in EZVPN with pre-shared key, where additional layer of security is provided by performing user authentication.\nOnce IKE SA is established, the peers are ready to establish information about what traffic to protect and how to protect it. This will form an IPsec Security Association (SA) or phase 2, in an exchange called Quick Mode.\nOnce quick mode is performed and IPsec SA exists and traffic is able to flow in a secured way.\nSo lets expand a bit on ESP and AH. \n![[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KentoHardRok/obsidian-notes/main/Pasted%20image%2020211027103305.png?token=ADLRAVIB4W7MVYUHU5YBIXDBQAVX4]]\nThis images paints a pretty good literal picture of the differences between the two. The description can better highlight why its beneficial to use both.\nAH is responsible for data integrity, AKA the data hasnt been messed with in transit. ESP is responsible for data encrypion, or that no one can eavesdrop on the data as its in transit.\nAnd now lets slightly discuss the two modes of IPSec, Transport mode vs Tunnel mode. AH and ESP can be applied to either one, the main difference between these two are the use cases. If two points are directly connecting to eacher with no other clients behind them then transport mode is the ideal choice. Transport maintains the originating source and destination IP's of those encrypting the data. This varies from Tunnel mode who can take in data in the clear and then encrypts the entire packet with a new IP source and destination. The tunnel mode is a better option because it obfuscates the original source and destination behind encrypters.\nSource\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/ipsec-ip-port-info/","title":"IPSec IP Port Info"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/mpls-details/":{"body":"#vpn/layer2/mpls #bgp/mpls #ospf \nMPLS details and configuration\nI'm working on a network in a mixed environment consisting of mostly Juniper devices for the backbone but some cisco devices alone the edges. This configuration is for evpn-mpls for this setup. Now lets discuss mpls for a quick minute.\nStarting from the basics, MPLS is a layer 2 vpn technology that makes the provider network almost invisible. What I mean by that is that, with layer two extended between sites, the customer is able to use their own IP space through the links and not worry about creating several smaller networks but rather treat all of their sites as a single network which they own.\nSo lets take a step back, MPLS stands for Multi-protocol Label Switching and it provides a way to forward multiple protocols across a network. In the simpliest of terms what happens is, as packets arrive on the network the receive a label which is used to make decisions on the network such as who learns about those routes and which routes they follow. \nMPLS is the means of relying on those labels for forwarding decsisions. These labels actually reside betweem the layer 2 header and the IP packet. \n![[https://github.com/KentoHardRok/obsidian-notes/blob/main/Pasted%20image%2020211028144911.png?raw=true]]\nFrom this graph we see that the layer 2 header is still the outer header which means it still uses layer two as its forwarding mechanism. The MPLS header is just additional information that can be acted on once a device discards L2 header. This then leads to the main functions of MPLS when it comes to the label. PUSH, POP, and SWAP. \n\nPushing a label happens to network entering an MPLS network.\nSwapping happens inside of the MPLS network and represents the basic forwarding action MPLS relies on. \nPopping a tag occurs when traffic leaves an MPLS network.\n\nso thats some basic musings to get us going. Lets start tagging some traffic in our Juniper Network.\nOnce the network is established and IP'd, we then add the MPLS family to the port and subsequently we add MPLS as a protocol to the device which we add the interfaces to.\nset interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family mpls\nset protocols mpls interface ge-0/0/1.0\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/mpls-details/","title":"MPLS Deets"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/routing-protocols/":{"body":"#vpn/layer2\nLayer 2 VPN services\ntypically this is used so the customer can manage their own network, making the network or the service provider almost transparent.

This is used in distince vector routing protocols such as ospf and ISIS in QOS. This routes packets bassed on certain constraints, the path could be exactly the same as the IGP or it could take on a whole new path as long as it meets the constraints (which could be things like bandwith). \n#vpn/layer2/vll\nVirtual Leased Line\njust a type of layer 2 vpn technology, its like a leased line that offers point to point connectivity.

Enable authentication through a tacacs+ server... definitely on the to do list  but as of today, thats a problem for tomorrow.\nLogging best practices dictate logging to a central service. to do that:\nlogging-plane host\n\tmanagement-interface\n\nYou also have configuration options to log to ATA flash that is persistent on reboot which is definitely useful but not the better options. To be fair you can also use this in conjunction with a central logging server.\nNow for some logging things to avoid. No logging to console or monitor\nno logging console  \nno logging monitor\n\nAs an alternative to logging to either console or monitor its suggested, if you must, to log to buffer to troubleshooting purposes. \nlogging buffered 16384 6\n\nWhen logging its also important to control what interfaces are sending logs and be sure to monitor that traffic. To that end set the logging source manually, preferably to the loopback interface which you should be using for management traffic.\nlogging source-interface Loopback 0\n\na few other helpful commands to ensure your logs are accurate include.\nclock timezone PST -8  \nservice timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone\n\nUse Secure Protocols when possible\nUse the more secure protocols when given the option. i.e. SSH over telnet or SCP in stead of FTP or TFTP. These commands facilitate ssh and scp:\nThis configuration example enable ssh services:\nhostname router\nip domain-name example.com  \ncrypto key generate rsa modulus 2048  \nip ssh time-out 60  \nip ssh authentication-retries 3  \nip ssh source-interface GigabitEthernet 0/1  \nip ssh version 2\n!  \nline vty 0 4  \n transport input ssh  \n\nThis configuration example enables SCP services:\nip scp server enable  \n\nThis is a configuration example for HTTPS services:\ncrypto key generate rsa modulus 2048  \nip http secure-server\n\nGain Traffic Visibility with netflow\nOriginally intended to export traffic to a management application, it can be used to monitor traffic real time.\nConfiguration Management\nSo Cisco IOS has built into it a feature to locally hold backup configurations so that you can roll back when necessary. This is different than simply copying a configuration file as the rollback completely replaces the running configuration as opposed to adding on the additional commands. \narchive  \n path disk0:archived-config  \n maximum 14  \n time-period 1440  \n write-memory\n\nThis configuration example above adds an archive with a maximum amount of 14 backups completed daily (1440 min) as well as a backup each time write mem is completed\nAlso important in config management is to ensure only one person can write to a device at any one time.\nconfiguration mode exclusive auto\n\nleast we forget to secure our boot image and config\nsecure boot-img\nsecure boot-config\n\nSo one other config management consideration which is pretty helpful is to enable config change notifications.\narchive  \n log config  \n  logging enable  \n  logging size 200  \n  hidekeys  \n  notify syslog\n\nManagement Plane\nFunctions that achieve the management goals of the network.\nPassword Management\nRequired Commands:\nenable secret\nservice password-encryption\n\nEnhanced Password Security\nThis feature was introduced in Cisco IOS 12.2(8) and it allows the passwords to be configured with MD5 hashing, The required commands are:\nusername &lt;name&gt; secret &lt;password&gt;\n\nLogin Password Retry Lockout\nThis allows you to lock out a local user account after a configured number of unsuccessful login attempts. Once locked out, their account is locked until you unlock it. An authorized user with privilege level 15 cannot be locked out with this feature. Keep priv 15 users to a minimum. The required commands are:\naaa new-model  \naaa local authentication attempts max-fail &lt;max-attempts&gt;\naaa authentication login default local\n\nImportant to established admin priv level with some limitations below 15\nNo Service Password-Recovery\nThis does not allow anyone with console access to insecurely access the device config and clear the password. It also does not allow malicious users to change the config registry value and access NVRAM. Required Commands are:\nno service password-recovery\n\nthis prevents the use of rommon on recovery and instead a backup of the config is suggested in case of emergencies. \nDisable unused services\nTurn off unused services... The TCP and UDP small services must be disabled. These services include:\n\necho (port number 7)\ndiscard (port number 9)\ndaytime (port number 13)\nchargen (port number 19)\t\nFortunately these are turned off by default but instead there are a few other features that can be turned off. Remember that these are only suggestions on alternative services that are enabled and should be disabled only if they are not needed.\nno ip finger global configuration command in order to disable finger service\nno ip bootp server global config, disable bootstrap protocol (BOOTP)\nip dhcp bootp ignore global config, to disable BOOTP although this leaves DHCP serves enables\nno service dhcp global config, to disable DHC relay services if they are not needed.\nno mop enabled interface config, to disable maintenance operation protocol\nno ip domain-lookup global config, to disable DNS services\nno service pad global config, to disable Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD), used for x.25 networks\nno ip http server | no ip http secure-server global config, to disable http ad https servers respectively.\nno service config global config, unless the device pulls its config from the network during startup, this command MUST be used. This prevents the IOS device from an attempt to locate a configuration file on the network.\nno cdp enable interface config, CDP must be disabled on all interfaces touching untrusted networks. no cdp run global config, can also be used to disable cdp globally. \nno lldp transmit &amp; no lldp receive interface config, this is the same threat and rationale as cdp usage. also no lldp run issued to disable it globally if not used at all.\n\nEXEC Timeout\nthis is used to set the interval the exec command waits for user input before it terminates the session. \nline con 0  \nexec-timeout &lt;minutes&gt; [seconds]  \nline vty 0 4  \nexec-timeout &lt;minutes&gt; [seconds]\n\nKeepalive for TCP sessions\nEnabling TCP keepalives both in and out of the device ensure the tcp connections remain active and half-opened or orphaned TCP connections are removed. The commands required are:\nservice tcp-keepalives-in  \nservice tcp-keepalives-out\n\nManagement Interface Use\nIts important to use a configured loopback address for either in-bound or Out-of-bound management access. Physical interfaces ay go down but loopbacks are always up. Required commands are:\ninterface Loopback0\n\tip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0\n\nMemory Threshold Notification\nIn order to mitigate low memory conditions on your cisco IOS device you should deploy:\nmemory free low-watermark processor &lt;threshold&gt;\nmemory free low-watermark io &lt;threshold&gt; \n\nMemory Threshold Notification generates a log message in order to indicate that free memory on a device has fallen lower than the configured threshold. \nThere is also a command used to be sure there is sufficient memory for delivering critical notifications. \nmemory reserve critical &lt;value&gt;\n\nThese commands are concerned with your devices being overwhelmed by anyone of several attacks that could increase the memory usage of your IOS device.\nCPU Threshold Notification\nSame idea as above, except for CPU threshold:\nsnmp-server enable traps cpu threshold  \nsnmp-server host &lt;host-address&gt; &lt;community-string&gt; cpu   \n!  \nprocess cpu threshold type &lt;type&gt; rising &lt;percentage&gt; interval &lt;seconds&gt;   \n     [falling &lt;percentage&gt; interval &lt;seconds&gt;]  \nprocess cpu statistics limit entry-percentage &lt;number&gt; [size &lt;seconds&gt;]  \n\nReserve memory for Console Access\nThis reserves memory to assure you can access device via console in case of an emergency.\nmemory reserve console 4096\n\nEnhanced Crash info File Collection\nreclaims memory for crash info\nexception crashinfo maximum files &lt;number-of-files&gt;\n\nNetwork Time Protocol\nAlthough not inherently dangerous, it needs to be secured. Its important for IPSec as well as logging. All devices should agree on time information otherwise its difficult to correlate events with each other. Suggested to use NTP authenticate here's how. \nClient:\n(config)#**ntp authenticate**  \n(config)#**ntp authentication-key 5 md5 ciscotime**  \n(config)#**ntp trusted-key 5**  \n(config)#**ntp server 172.16.1.5 key 5**\n\nServer:\n(config)#**ntp authenticate**  \n(config)#**ntp authentication-key 5 md5 ciscotime**  \n(config)#**ntp trusted-key 5**\n\nHere I will just remind you that ACLs exist and you should use them. There are examples of things to filter but ultimately this is something you have to decide on in your environment.\nAux Port access\nline AUX has a lot of privileges that make it dangerous and it should be secured in most cases, and by secured I mean disabled. This is of course you dont intend to use it for things like password recovery. Here is how you do that:\nline aux 0  \n transport input none  \n transport output none  \n no exec  \n exec-timeout 0 1  \n no password\n\nUse TACACS+\nJust use it already, it can be free. There are tutorials, use it for user/admin authentication on your network devices. Radius is also an option but it only encrypts the password where as TACACS+ encrypts the whole TCP payload. Here are the commands needed to enable TACACS+ on a cisco device:\naaa new-model  \naaa authentication login default group tacacs+ enable\n!  \ntacacs-server host &lt;ip-address-of-tacacs-server&gt;  \ntacacs-server key &lt;key&gt;\n\nthe above configuration also allows for a secondary authentication method, enable is used but you can also fallback to local which would use your local username and password. \nCommand Authorization\nGives you the ability to permit or deny commands entered by an administrator based on their priv level:\naaa authorization exec default group tacacs none  \naaa authorization commands 0 default group tacacs none  \naaa authorization commands 1 default group tacacs none   \naaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs none\n\nCommand Accounting\nSends information about each EXEC command that is entered: \naaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs   \naaa accounting commands 0 default start-stop group tacacs  \naaa accounting commands 1 default start-stop group tacacs  \naaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs\n\nalso redundant servers ...\nSNMP services\nJust use SNMPv3. Not 2 if you want to use it at all. SNMPv3 consists of three primary configuration options:\n\nno auth - This mode does not require any authentication nor any encryption of SNMP packets\nauth - This mode requires authentication of the SNMP packet without encryption\npriv - This mode requires both authentication and encryption (privacy) of each SNMP packet\n\nThis command configures a Cisco IOS device for SNMPv3 with an SNMP server group AUTHGROUP and enables only authentication for this group with the \nauth keyword:\nsnmp-server group AUTHGROUP v3 auth\n\nThis command configures a Cisco IOS device for SNMPv3 with an SNMP server group PRIVGROUP and enables both authentication and encryption for this group with the priv keyword:\nsnmp-server group PRIVGROUP v3 priv\n\nThis command configures an SNMPv3 user snmpv3user with an MD5 authentication password of authpassword and a 3DES encryption password of privpassword:\nsnmp-server user snmpv3user PRIVGROUP v3 auth md5 authpassword priv 3des privpassword\n\nManagement Plane Protection\nAlso an important part to this SNMP puzzle is the management plane protection.  Once MPP is enabled, only the interfaces identified as management may accpt management traffic. The command to do so is :\ncontrol-plane host  \n management-interface FastEthernet0/0 allow ssh snmp   \n\nControl Plane Hardening\nHere are just a few commands to help do just that. Harden the control plane. Usually has to do with the way rouge packets and random pings are handled... or not.\nIP ICMP Redirects\nFiltering with an interface access list elicits the transmission of ICMP unreachable messages back to the source of the filtered traffic. The generation of these messages can increase CPU utilization on the device. In Cisco IOS software, ICMP unreachable generation is limited to one packet every 500 milliseconds by default\ndont do it. \nno ip icmp redirects\n\nIP proxy arp\nProxy ARP is the technique in which one device, usually a router, answers ARP requests that are intended for another device. By \"faking\" its identity, the router accepts responsibility for routing packets to the real destination. Proxy ARP can help machines on a subnet reach remote subnets without configuring routing or a default gateway\ndont do it\nno ip proxy-arp\n\nThis is an interface problem but I think that it can be done in both global and interface level. \nEtcetera\nSo at this point this is all of the general OS hardening, There is a lot more than can and should be done with access lists but that really is something that should be tailored to your environment. The idea there is that you allow only what you need and block everything else. To be fair it does get much more complex than that.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/securing-the-config-copy/","title":"Harden IOS, pretty much"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/vxlan-explained/":{"body":"#vxlan #encapsulation\nVXLAN description\n\nVXLAN provides a method of creating multitenant overlay by encapsulating packets in IP/UDP along with a header containing a network identifier which is used to isolate tenant traffic in each overlay network from eachother. This allows the overlay networks to run over an existing IP network.\nThrough this encapsulation, VXLAN creates stateless tunnels between vxlan tunnel endpoints (VTEPs) which are responsible for adding/removing the IP/UDP headers and providing tenant traffic isolation based on the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). Tenant systems are unaware that their networking service is being provided by an overlay network.\" \nWhen encapsulating packets, a vtep must know the IP address of the proper remote VTEP at the far end of the tunnel that can delier the inner packet to the tenant system corresponding to the inner destination address.\n\nThis was a direct pull from an rfc submitted for a modified version of vxlan which added support for generic protocol extensions to the header, allowing for multiprotocol encapsulation beyond udp. Although I haven't seen this implemented yet, this short description of VXLAN is pretty on point and easy to understand. I think it serves as a good primer as well as a reminder when you step away from the protocol for a while and need to remind yourself of some of the terms and what they mean.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/vxlan-explained/","title":"VXLAN explained"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/","title":"Random Learnings"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/git-outta-here/":{"body":"#git/remoteadd\nGit Learnings\nWhen you create a new repo and just need to add existing info to that repo this is what you would do\n\necho \"# obsidian-notes\" &gt;&gt; README.md\ngit init\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:KentoHardRok/notes.git\ngit push -u origin main\n\nSo just a little context for my own well being. You have an option, either to create a local git repo or clone someone elses. Once you have a folder being tracked by your local git you can add a new remote origin (not sure if im using that right to be honest) what that means is when you do a pull or push its actually going to a new place. \nIn the instructions above I created a new repo on my github, then on my local folder I initiated the git tracking, created my first commit then added the origin of the repo I created.

SO, what's significant to remember is that this is used to interpret variables. so that $NUM will become 5 or whatever you have assigned. When it comes to strings it will also display strings as is and interpret things like line end /n. \n' - single quote literally interprets what is placed within it. so @NUM becomes @NUM, literally. thats all there is to that.\n' - the back tick is used to run commands, so bash and such is interpreted with this. Text between backticks is executed and replaced by the output of the command. That is called command substitution because it is substituted with the output of the command. So if you want to print 5, you can't use backticks, you can use quotation marks, like echo \"$b\" or just drop any quotation and use echo $b.\n#sed\nsed things\nsearch and replace strange things\nreplace the seperator\nso if your string includes characters such as /, it will mess up your command, so you can change the default seperator. You enter a quote single or double, then the s for search then the next character will be the new seperator for this command. \"s|apple|orange|g\" this would replace apple with orange.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/bash-learnings/","title":"Bashing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/python-learnings/":{"body":"#scripting/python3\nPython Shebang\nwhen I just start learning things like this I tend to forget a lot of the basic stuff, especially if the program im using automates everything for me.

The catch is that there are only a hand full of configs that you need to mess with to get a client making calls on your system. So that begs the question, why so many files then? Well you CAN do a lot with this system. Of course online tutorials are geared towards getting you started and thats about it but as I remember the things I went through to get this system up I'll try and write this stuff down.\nFirst file which I feel is the most essential is extensions.conf. This file is essential your dial plan, or how calls are able to reach other. Coming from a networking background I tend to think of this as the voip routing table. You can use regex expressions to really make this a flexible file. Some of the things that I have had some experience with is using the different switches. When configuring Active Directory (LDAP) as the user database for asterisk you can use the realtime switch to perform dialplan look ups on the ldap database. Thats not the only way to accomplish this though. When you sync with a database you still can query the database directly from the extensions.conf file. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Voip's/nice-asterisk/","title":"Nice Asterisk"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1024/":{"body":22,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-1/":{"body":311,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-2/":{"body":630,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-3/":{"body":395,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/dockfu/":{"body":210,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/where-have-you-been/":{"body":25,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/cisco-ipsec-configs/":{"body":509,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/ipsec-ip-port-info/":{"body":253,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/mpls-details/":{"body":212,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/routing-protocols/":{"body":126,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/securing-the-config-copy/":{"body":1410,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/vxlan-explained/":{"body":131,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/git-outta-here/":{"body":98,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/bash-learnings/":{"body":172,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/python-learnings/":{"body":24,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/VPN Info/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/VPN Info/wireguard-setup/":{"body":192,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Voip's/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Voip's/nice-asterisk/":{"body":124,"title":2}},"length":25},"lang":"English"};

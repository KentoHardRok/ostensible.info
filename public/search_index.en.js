https://easydocs.codeandmedia.com/\nThis theme for Zola (static site engine) helps you build and publish your project docs easily and fast. Zola is just one binary that outputs html-pages and additional static assets after building your docs written in Markdown. Thus, you can take the theme, your md-files, Zola and gain flexible and simple website for documentation. \nStep-by-step&nbsp;\nAs you may have heard Zola is quite flexible :) So, the scenario below is one of hundreds possible ways to make things done, feel free to find your best. Also, Zola provides their own mechanism to install and use themes, see the docs. \n\nFork the repo and replace demo-content inside content folder with yours. But take a look to _index.md files. It contains title and when you want to have anchor right of your headers add insert_anchor_links = \"right\" to each index. theme.toml, screenshot and readme may be deleted too. \nInside config.toml change URL and title on your own. In extra section you can specify path to your GitHub API for version below the logo on nav, favicon and logo itself. Or just remove the lines if you don't need it. Also, you can configure or turn on some additional settings related to Zola. Specification is here.\nIn sass/_variables.scss you may change font, color or backgound if you want. \nAlmost done. Now, you should decide how you want to build and where will be hosted your website. You can build it locally and upload to somewhere. Or build in GitHub Actions and host on GitHub Pages / Netlify / CloudFlare Pages / AnyS3CloudStorage. Howto for GitHub Pages. My example of GitHub workflow with 2-steps build (the first checks for links and spelling errors, the second uploads to Azure).

There are a few steps that are necessary and some that are optional. \nFROM alpine:latest\nRUN apk update &amp;&amp; \\\n    apk upgrade &amp;&amp; \\ \n    apk add \\\n        wireguard-tools \\\n        iptables \\\n        bash\nENV WG_PORT=51820\nENV NUM_CLIENTS=5\nENV PRIV_NET=10.0.0.\nENV EXT_IP=172.16.0.10\nWORKDIR /etc/wireguard\nCOPY wg0.conf wgpeer.conf peer_setup.conf ./\nCOPY createwg /usr/local/bin/\nRUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/createwg &amp;&amp; \\\n    mkdir client\nENTRYPOINT [\"createwg\"] \nCMD [\"wg-quick\",\"up\",\"wg0\"]\n\nThis isnt the most perfect dockerfile but it is mine and I can walk through it pretty easily. From the top we have the FROM command, this sets the base image. Its not a good idea to use the latest tag for the version because it could update and break things.\nThe next example we have is the RUN tag. This is a command that is run during the build process. This is important as it is not re run after the image is built so make sure this is used to establish the environment for the container. \nENV and not used here is ARG. In this ENV is used to make environmental variables inside the new image that can be used by scripts and programs inside the container once the image is run. These ENV variables can be modified during run time. ARG is similar but only used during the image being built. These values can not be modified during runtime. \nWORKDIR does exactly that, changes the working directory while image is built. \nCOPY is used to copy files to and from the container.\nENTRYPOINT is the next interesting command with its brother CMD. they are both commands that are run during image run time. so when you say docker run &lt;image&gt; these commands are run, the difference between these two is that entrpoint cannot be changed with a command line argument during runtime BUT CMD can be changed. ENTRYPOINT cannot be changed but CMD can be changed. easy enough right? source\nThe real beauty in all of this is when you run a command or process using a container, it can be the perfect environment for that application, guaranteed to run then bail and disappear when finished. you just have to know what that environment shoud look like.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/dockfu/","title":"Dockerfu"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/","title":"Links"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/where-have-you-been/":{"body":"SiteDescriptionLink\nAnswerLookupHow to add GIT to windows pathAdd GIT to PATH\nThe Geek DiaryPhysical interface to dockerHow To\nspeedguide.netGreat site for researching ip port infoPort Info\nDAS BlinkinReally smart guy who has saved me in the pastblog\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/where-have-you-been/","title":"Where have I been"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/","title":"Networking Info"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/cisco-ipsec-configs/":{"body":"#vpn/layer3/ipsec #cisco/asa \nIPSec config examples\nSo there are 2 main phases to an IPSec. There is the initial key exchange which is necesary to establish credentials to the second phase which is the enctypting of traffic. For the first phase the here is an example config that I'll follow up with an explanation.\ncrypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal sec-prop\n protocol esp encryption aes-256\n protocol esp integrity sha-512\n\nThe first line is basically the titling of this transform set on this ikev2 transform set. The second command is establishing the encryption protocol used to establish the ike communication. All of these settings must match on both sides. The third line is the Authentication hash for data integrity of the ike connection. \nCrypto ipsec security-association pmtu-aging infinte\n\nThis command actually establishes global defaults for lifetime in the ipsec phase 2. If you configure the times in the crypto map than this time will not be used. \ncrypto map tunmap 1 match address tun-traffic\ncrypto map tunmap 1 set peer 192.168.100.2\ncrypto map tunmap 1 set ikev2 ipsec-propsal sec-prop\ncrypto map tunmap interface outside\n\nThis is the phase 2 tunnel map configuration. More or less the glue of the tunnel to bring together the different phases. The first line highlights significant traffic through an access list. The second line labels the peers IP address. The 3rd line ties in the phase one tunnel configuration. The final like actually turns on the tunnel on to an interface. \ncrypto iaskmp identity key-id hq-tun-group\n\nThis line is used when an asa connects through a nat configuration. This passes a new isakmp identity so it can be identified as something other than the outside interface IP address. This happens because the tunnel groups are labeled with the IP address which the certificates use to label the endpoints, so this command should match the id to a name tunnel-group on the peer.\ncrypto ikev2 policy 1\n  encryption aes-256\n  integrity sha\n  group 21\n  prf sha512\n  lifetime seconds 36500\n\nHere is the significant part of the IPSec phase 2 condfiguration which labels the aspects of the ipsec tunnel. Here we still have the ecryption standard used, integrirty hash, DH group selected, PRF or the pseudo random function is whats used to create keying material. Then finally the the lifetime of each key.\ncrypto ikev2 enable outside\n\nAnd this is the command needed to enable the phase 2 on the outside interface. By phase 2 I mean ipsec tunnel.\nWe must configure the group policy which is where we set the phase one protocol to use.\n  group-policy 192.168.100.2 internal\n  group-policy 192.168.100.2 attributes\n  \tvpn-tunnel-protocol ikev2\n\nNow we move onto the fun stuff, tunnel group configuration. This is the portion that sets the tunnel attributes like authentication details, certificate or pre-shared key to be used. The tunnel group name should match the peers external info which I am pretty sure is the CN field in the certificate they present. I'll revisit this... maybe.Ok this blog that I have stumbled upon, who has helped in the past dives a little deeper into this topic and I think its worth noting here as well. \nThe tunnel groups are kind of like the core of the vpn configuration. There are two main elements to the tunnel groups, Attributes and Types. \ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 type ipsec-l2l\n\nthis is an example of the tunnel group type. Although this is a l2l type there are other options. \n| Types         |                                                |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| ipsec-l2l     | l2l configurations                             |\n| ipsec-ra      | The old IPSec client vpn type (deprecated)     |\n| remote-access | The new client vpn type for both SSL and IPSec |\n| webvpn        | The old SSL client vpn type (deprecated)       |\n| Attribute Sets     |                                                                        |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| generel-attributes | general attributes used with most tunnel group configurations          |\n| ipsec-attributes   | specific IPSec attributes used for l2l and client IPSec configurations |\n| ppp-attributes     | specific ppp attributes                                                |\n| webvpn-attributes  | specific ssl attributes used for webvpn configurations                 |\nHere we can see some of the configuration options and the pairs of tunnel group types with the attributes.\ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 type ipsec-l2l\ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 general-attributes\n default-group-policy 192.168.100.2\n\nThis also is the section that connects the group policy to the tunnel group. I feel like its important to identify how these different sections connect to eachother.\nThe tunnel group would be where the we would define authentication. The default is to authenticate locally but of course you can use ldap or other radius authentication as well.\ntunnel-group 192.168.100.2 ipsec-attributes\n ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key *****\n ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-key *****\n\nThe only aspect I didnt really touch on here is the ACL needed to identify interesting traffic. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/cisco-ipsec-configs/","title":"Cisco IPSec Configs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/ipsec-ip-port-info/":{"body":"#vpn/ipsec\nIPSec Port information\nPort/ProtocolIPSec (VPN tunneling) uses:\nProtocol 50ESP Encapsulation Header\nProtocol 51AH Authentication Header\nudp/500(IKE) Internet Key Exchange\nudp/4500NAT traversal\n\nIKE or the internet key exchange is used to form a secure connection so that keys can be exchanged between clients. There is a lot to dig into this topic such as aggressive mode vs main mode and the security implications of both.\nok lets dive a little since we are here anyway. Necessary information include how to connect: hashing algorithm to use, encryption, and DH group, and desired IKE SA. The DH exchange will need to be performed to send a secret over an insecure medium. Finally the peers exchange identities and authentication material.\nIKE SA can be established via aggressive mode or main mode negotiation, this document covers Main Mode exchange which is the one typically deployed.\nAggressive mode is the less secure of modes and is typically used in EZVPN with pre-shared key, where additional layer of security is provided by performing user authentication.\nOnce IKE SA is established, the peers are ready to establish information about what traffic to protect and how to protect it. This will form an IPsec Security Association (SA) or phase 2, in an exchange called Quick Mode.\nOnce quick mode is performed and IPsec SA exists and traffic is able to flow in a secured way.\nSo lets expand a bit on ESP and AH. \n![[Pasted image 20211027103305.png]]\nThis images paints a pretty good literal picture of the differences between the two. The description can better highlight why its beneficial to use both.\nAH is responsible for data integrity, AKA the data hasnt been messed with in transit. ESP is responsible for data encrypion, or that no one can eavesdrop on the data as its in transit.\nAnd now lets slightly discuss the two modes of IPSec, Transport mode vs Tunnel mode. AH and ESP can be applied to either one, the main difference between these two are the use cases. If two points are directly connecting to eacher with no other clients behind them then transport mode is the ideal choice. Transport maintains the originating source and destination IP's of those encrypting the data. This varies from Tunnel mode who can take in data in the clear and then encrypts the entire packet with a new IP source and destination. The tunnel mode is a better option because it obfuscates the original source and destination behind encrypters.\nSource\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/ipsec-ip-port-info/","title":"IPSec IP Port Info"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/mpls-details/":{"body":"#vpn/layer2/mpls #bgp/mpls #ospf \nMPLS details and configuration\nI'm working on a network in a mixed environment consisting of mostly Juniper devices for the backbone but some cisco devices alone the edges. This configuration is for evpn-mpls for this setup. Now lets discuss mpls for a quick minute.\nStarting from the basics, MPLS is a layer 2 vpn technology that makes the provider network almost invisible. What I mean by that is that, with layer two extended between sites, the customer is able to use their own IP space through the links and not worry about creating several smaller networks but rather treat all of their sites as a single network which they own.\nSo lets take a step back, MPLS stands for Multi-protocol Label Switching and it provides a way to forward multiple protocols across a network. In the simpliest of terms what happens is, as packets arrive on the network the receive a label which is used to make decisions on the network such as who learns about those routes and which routes they follow. \nMPLS is the means of relying on those labels for forwarding decsisions. These labels actually reside betweem the layer 2 header and the IP packet. \n![[Pasted image 20211028144911.png]]\nFrom this graph we see that the layer 2 header is still the outer header which means it still uses layer two as its forwarding mechanism. The MPLS header is just additional information that can be acted on once a device discards L2 header. This then leads to the main functions of MPLS when it comes to the label. PUSH, POP, and SWAP. \n\nPushing a label happens to network entering an MPLS network.\nSwapping happens inside of the MPLS network and represents the basic forwarding action MPLS relies on. \nPopping a tag occurs when traffic leaves an MPLS network.\n\nso thats some basic musings to get us going. Lets start tagging some traffic in our Juniper Network.\nOnce the network is established and IP'd, we then add the MPLS family to the port and subsequently we add MPLS as a protocol to the device which we add the interfaces to.\nset interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family mpls\nset protocols mpls interface ge-0/0/1.0\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/mpls-details/","title":"MPLS Deets"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/routing-protocols/":{"body":"#vpn/layer2\nLayer 2 VPN services\ntypically this is used so the customer can manage their own network, making the network or the service provider almost transparent.

This is used in distince vector routing protocols such as ospf and ISIS in QOS. This routes packets bassed on certain constraints, the path could be exactly the same as the IGP or it could take on a whole new path as long as it meets the constraints (which could be things like bandwith). \n#vpn/layer2/vll\nVirtual Leased Line\njust a type of layer 2 vpn technology, its like a leased line that offers point to point connectivity. Another name this goes by is VPWS or virtual private wire service. The pseudowire used in this connection is essentially a point-to-point MPLS connection. It is the simplest type and has the least amount of resource consumption.\n#vpn/layer2/vpls\nVirtual Private LAN Service\nSimply put it enables multipoint connectivity at layer 2 within an enterprise. thats the tag line anyway.

This allows the overlay networks to run over an existing IP network.\nThrough this encapsulation, VXLAN creates stateless tunnels between vxlan tunnel endpoints (VTEPs) which are responsible for adding/removing the IP/UDP headers and providing tenant traffic isolation based on the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). Tenant systems are unaware that their networking service is being provided by an overlay network.\" \nWhen encapsulating packets, a vtep must know the IP address of the proper remote VTEP at the far end of the tunnel that can delier the inner packet to the tenant system corresponding to the inner destination address.\n\nThis was a direct pull from an rfc submitted for a modified version of vxlan which added support for generic protocol extensions to the header, allowing for multiprotocol encapsulation beyond udp. Although I haven't seen this implemented yet, this short description of VXLAN is pretty on point and easy to understand. I think it serves as a good primer as well as a reminder when you step away from the protocol for a while and need to remind yourself of some of the terms and what they mean.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/vxlan-explained/","title":"VXLAN explained"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/","title":"Random Learnings"},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/git-outta-here/":{"body":"#git/remoteadd\nGit Learnings\nWhen you create a new repo and just need to add existing info to that repo this is what you would do\n\necho \"# obsidian-notes\" &gt;&gt; README.md\ngit init\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:KentoHardRok/notes.git\ngit push -u origin main\n\nSo just a little context for my own well being. You have an option, either to create a local git repo or clone someone elses. Once you have a folder being tracked by your local git you can add a new remote origin (not sure if im using that right to be honest) what that means is when you do a pull or push its actually going to a new place. \nIn the instructions above I created a new repo on my github, then on my local folder I initiated the git tracking, created my first commit then added the origin of the repo I created.

SO, what's significant to remember is that this is used to interpret variables. so that $NUM will become 5 or whatever you have assigned. When it comes to strings it will also display strings as is and interpret things like line end /n. \n' - single quote literally interprets what is placed within it. so @NUM becomes @NUM, literally. thats all there is to that.\n' - the back tick is used to run commands, so bash and such is interpreted with this. Text between backticks is executed and replaced by the output of the command. That is called command substitution because it is substituted with the output of the command. So if you want to print 5, you can't use backticks, you can use quotation marks, like echo \"$b\" or just drop any quotation and use echo $b.\n#sed\nsed things\nsearch and replace strange things\nreplace the seperator\nso if your string includes characters such as /, it will mess up your command, so you can change the default seperator.

The catch is that there are only a hand full of configs that you need to mess with to get a client making calls on your system. So that begs the question, why so many files then? Well you CAN do a lot with this system. Of course online tutorials are geared towards getting you started and thats about it but as I remember the things I went through to get this system up I'll try and write this stuff down.\nFirst file which I feel is the most essential is extensions.conf. This file is essential your dial plan, or how calls are able to reach other. Coming from a networking background I tend to think of this as the voip routing table. You can use regex expressions to really make this a flexible file. Some of the things that I have had some experience with is using the different switches. When configuring Active Directory (LDAP) as the user database for asterisk you can use the realtime switch to perform dialplan look ups on the ldap database. Thats not the only way to accomplish this though. When you sync with a database you still can query the database directly from the extensions.conf file. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Voip's/nice-asterisk/","title":"Nice Asterisk"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1024/":{"body":189,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/AWS/week-1/":{"body":112,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Dockerizer/dockfu/":{"body":210,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Links/where-have-you-been/":{"body":25,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/cisco-ipsec-configs/":{"body":509,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/ipsec-ip-port-info/":{"body":254,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/mpls-details/":{"body":213,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/routing-protocols/":{"body":126,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Networking Info/vxlan-explained/":{"body":131,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Random Learnings/git-outta-here/":{"body":98,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/bash-learnings/":{"body":172,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Scripting/python-learnings/":{"body":24,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/VPN Info/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/VPN Info/wireguard-setup/":{"body":192,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Voip's/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1024/Voip's/nice-asterisk/":{"body":125,"title":2}},"length":22},"lang":"English"};
